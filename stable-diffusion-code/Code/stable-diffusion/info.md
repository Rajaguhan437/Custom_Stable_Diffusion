# Dreambooth-Stable diffusion :

-   ### This is the python file by which        
      -    downloads all the necessary libaray and dependcies 
      -    login's into hugging-face via token authentication 
      -    download's the required pre-trained model
      -    accepts a set of images to train the model
      -    then trains the model particulary for the set of given images
      -    then image is generated based on the prompts and other parameters.
          
-  **NOTE** ==> This is txt2img generation.
     
 # Img2img diffusers using stable-diffusion diffusers :

-   ### This is also a python script written on jupyter notebook        
      -    downloads all the necessary libaray and dependcies 
      -    login's into hugging-face via token authentication 
      -    loads the required pre-trained or trained model
      -    **prompt** and an **image** is given as *input* 
      -    then image is generated and can be fine-tuned using other parameters and by prompting.
     
-  **NOTE** ==> This is img2img generation.

-   IT is better to run these scripts on google co-lab rather then local-machine.

-   Unless there is atleast 70GB of free space, with minimum OF 6GB RAM NVIDIA GPU.
