- Various pre-trained models are used to generate images in stable diffusion

- Some of the models which are good and used by me 

        [+]Stable diffusion v1.4   ==>  https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original/resolve/main/sd-v1-4.ckpt
        [+]Stable diffusion v1.5   ==>  https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5/resolve/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt
        [+]F222                    ==>  https://huggingface.co/acheong08/f222/blob/main/f222.ckpt
        [+]Anything V3             ==>  https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3.0/resolve/main/anything-v3-fp16-pruned.safetensors
        [+]Open Journey            ==>  https://huggingface.co/prompthero/openjourney/resolve/main/mdjrny-v4.ckpt
        [+]DreamShaper             ==>  https://civitai.com/api/download/models/5636?type=Pruned%20Model&format=SafeTensor
        [+]Mo-di-diffusion         ==>  https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke/mo-di-diffusion
        [+]Inkpunk Diffusion       ==>  https://huggingface.co/Envvi/Inkpunk-Diffusion
        [+]GTA5_Artwork_Diffusion  ==>  https://huggingface.co/ItsJayQz/GTA5_Artwork_Diffusion
        [+]stable-diffusion-2-1    ==>  https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1/blob/main/v2-1_768-ema-pruned.ckpt
        
- And still there are thousands of models present in hugging face..

- Automatic1111 presents an option of mixing of these models to produce a hybrid model. It allows a maximum of 3 models to be combined with varying percentage weights.
