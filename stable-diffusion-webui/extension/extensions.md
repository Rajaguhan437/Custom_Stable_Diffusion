- # Extensions :
  -  Here, Extensions are more like plugins which makes the development a lot faster.
      
  -  It can be easily installed just cloning the github repo link and installing it.
      
  -  Some important extensions are:
            -  [+]stable-diffusion-webui-Prompt_Generator     ==>  https://github.com/imrayya/stable-diffusion-webui-Prompt_Generator.git
            -  [+]sd-webui-ar  (aspect-ratio calculator)      ==>  https://github.com/alemelis/sd-webui-ar.git
            -  [+]openpose-editor                             ==>  https://github.com/fkunn1326/openpose-editor.git
            -  [+]sd-webui-controlnet (control-net)           ==>  https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet.git
            -  [+]sd-webui-depth-lib ( ,  , ,  )              ==>  https://github.com/jexom/sd-webui-depth-lib.git
         
         
- #  CONTROL NETS : 
        
         -    Normally, images generated by stable diffusion can be only controlled by prompt engineering. And that too is a guess work.
              But Controls Nets enables to have control each part of the image and there are various methods by which it is done.
         
         -    To know more about control nets, Refer here
                    ==>   https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet.git
         -    To Download those,
                    ==>   https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/tree/main/models
                
                
- ##  Requirements:
         
         -    Like models, it too requires large amount of storage space.
         -    Each Control-Net is around 5.71GB...
